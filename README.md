# FEC

Hello! Welcome to our team's Front End Capstone or FEC for short.

This was our first project as we entered the Senior Phase of the HackReactor Program. The goal of this project was to challenge, primiarly, our Front End Skills with the aim of building a complex webpage that interacts with an API, Server, and 4 widgets made by four different people while being thoroughly tested to ensure the best outcome. We had the oppurtunity to use some pretty darn cool technologies including React, Jest, HTML, CSS, Axios, Express and hopefully to no suprise Javascript!

Our team was made up of:
Ahmad Almomani responsible for the Product Overview
King-Man Chow responsible for the Related Products & Comparisons
Keegan Wolf responsible for the Question & Answers Section
Alex Belmonte responsible for the Ratings & Reviews

We're all excited for you to take a look at our project and can't wait to tell you more about it!
