# FEC

Hello! Welcome to our team's Front End Capstone, or FEC for short.

This was our first project as we entered the Senior Phase of the HackReactor Program. The goal of this project was to challenge, primiarly, our Front End Skills. The aim was to build a complex webpage that interacts with an API, server, and four widgets made by four different people while being thoroughly tested to ensure the best outcome. We had the oppurtunity to use some technologies including React, Jest, HTML, CSS, Axios, Express and, hopefully to no suprise, Javascript!

Our team was made up of:
* Ahmad Almomani, responsible for Product Overview.
* King-Man Chow, responsible for Related Products & Comparisons.
* Keegan Wolf, responsible for Question & Answers.
* Alex Belmonte, responsible for Ratings & Reviews.

## Description

Specifically, what we built was a product page for an online storefront. It is complete with everything you might expect in a modern online retailer, like a product overview, see related items, a place to ask questions, and to see reviews. The page is fully interactive as well! You can click around the different styles, compare a related item to the current item, leave a question or answer, and even leave a review.

Maybe we should add gifs of interactions of different things on the screen.

We're all excited for you to take a look at our project and can't wait to tell you more about it!
