# FEC

Hello! Welcome to our team's Front End Capstone, or FEC for short.

This was our first project as we entered the Senior Phase of the HackReactor Program. The goal of this project was to challenge, primiarly, our Front End Skills. The aim was to build a complex webpage that interacts with an API, server, and four widgets made by four different people while being thoroughly tested to ensure the best outcome. We had the oppurtunity to use some technologies including React, Jest, HTML, CSS, Axios, Express and, hopefully to no suprise, Javascript!

Our team was made up of:
*Ahmad Almomani, responsible for Product Overview.
*King-Man Chow, responsible for Related Products & Comparisons.
*Keegan Wolf, responsible for Question & Answers.
*Alex Belmonte, responsible for Ratings & Reviews.

We're all excited for you to take a look at our project and can't wait to tell you more about it!
